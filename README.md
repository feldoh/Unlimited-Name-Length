# Unlimited Name Length

Unlimited Pawn, faction and settlement name length.
All restrictions on names are removed so that means it's up to you to not make a name that Rimworld can't handle.
If you make a name so long it looks silly and doesn't fit in the UI, that's on you, I'm not trying to make it so the full works of Shakespeare can fit in a pawn name and still be in some way sensible.

Nb: Technically there is still a limit of 2147483647 or two billion one hundred forty-seven million four hundred eighty-three thousand six hundred forty-seven characters, but I think that's enough for most people.
